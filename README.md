 # breathing-circles-best 

This programs demonstrates the MakeCode Arcade Extension breathing-circles-best. The program draws expanding concentric circles, then deletes them in reverse order, creating a breathing effect. The code is simple because of the features of the extension. "Best" in the extension name indicates that it uses [circle-ext-best](../../../circle-ext-best) in the good-better-best extension series. 

## How to Use

Click the link in the About section to the right to open the program in a browser. 
Button A pauses the program until Button A is pressed again. 
Button B freezes the current screen as a background and continues breathing.
Arrow Buttons move the center of the concentric circles creating an artistic effect.
